How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  Interpreting user needs involves clear and effective communication to identify the underlying problems the user is trying to      solve, not just the surface level requests. User stories turn identified needs into clear development goals by outlining who      the user is, what they need, and why it matters. It's important for development to understand these elements to effectively       provide value to the user.
  
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  Prior to this course, I approached program development by trying to plan every portion of the program upfront. While that gave    me structure, it often left little room for change or feedback. Moving forward, I want to incorporate Agile practices like        sprint planning, consistent testing, and retrospectives to identify what went well and what can be improved upon.
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  In software development, especially in an Agile environment, open communication is crucial for building trust, sharing            progress, and making sure the team can adapt quickly to change. Collaboration is equally important, as it allows team members     to combine their skills, support one another, and solve problems more effectively. Open communication and collaboration allows    team members to catch issues early, make more informed decisions, and to stay aligned to project goals. It also creates a         culture of accountability, where team members are more likely to follow through on commitments and hold each other to higher      standards because wheat they contribute directly effects the success of the whole team. A good team member communicates           clearly, collaborates often, and helps uphold a standard of accountability that benefits the entire team.
